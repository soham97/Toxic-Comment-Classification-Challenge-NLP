# Kaggle's Toxic Comment Classification Challenge (NLP)

Part of my work for Kaggle's Toxic Comment Classification Challenge. <br>
Positioned 15th out of 4551 competitors. <br>
Competition details: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge <br>
Solution details and experience: https://soham97.github.io/Kaggle-Toxic-Comment-Challenge/

Shortform explanation used below:
<br />
BiLSTM: Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory
<br />
W2V: Gensim Word2Vec
<br />
attention: attention mechanism
<br />
DPCNN: Deep pyramid convolutional neural network
<br />
300d: Glove embeddings of 300d
<br />
logreg: logistic regression
<br />
prepost: Two different embeddings trained for initial part of sentence and for the end of sentence to counter the problems 
faced by RNNs when the sequence length becomes much larger
